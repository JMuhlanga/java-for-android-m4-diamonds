# Drawing ASCII Art

## Introduction:

In this assignment, you are to write Java code that produce an ASCII art picture that varies in
size based upon input given by the user.

## Learning Outcomes:

After completing this assignment, you will have experience with:
1. Writing loops that repeat some computation a specified number of times.
2. Writing conditional statements that alter the execution of your program based upon various
   criteria.
3. Writing methods that accept parameters to eliminate or reduce redundant code in your
   program.

## Resources:
   Please download the supplied zip file available with this specification. Extract the files onto your
   computer. The extracted files contain an Android Studio project. Start Android Studio and open
   the project as demonstrated in an earlier module. All your work for this assignment will be in the
   file Logic.java. Open this file in the IDE and look for the comment:
   // TODO -- add your code here
   As you do your work, be sure to place all your code in the process()method. If/when you add
   helper methods, be sure to place them inside the Logic class, after the process()method.
   For all output to appear on the screen of your Android device (or emulated device), all output
   should be sent to mOut and not System.out.
   In order for evaluators to do their job they will need to download and compile your code. Your
   code should therefore be importable into Android Studio, should compile without error, and
   should then run correctly on an emulated Android device. You should just upload the file
   Logic.java for evaluation by the assessors. When you assess the code of others, you can
   simply paste their Logic.java file into the provided Android Studio project so that you can
   compile and run it (you should have a copy of your own Logic.java first).

## Tasks:

   In this assignment, you are to write a program that will print an ASCII art drawing of a diamond
   in a picture frame that will be displayed on the screen of your Android device in a text box. You
   should exactly reproduce the format of the output samples below. This includes having identical
   characters and spacing. One way to write a Java program to draw this figure would be to write a
   println() statement that prints each line of the figure. However, this solution would not
   receive full credit. A major part of this assignment is showing that you understand for loops
   and if statements.
   Another significant component of this assignment is the task of generalizing the program using a
   variable to adjust the size of the figure. When the program is run, the user will select the size of
   the figure they want produced. You are provided with code that accesses that value and passes it
   to the method named process() in the integer parameter named size. Your code should be
   written in terms of the parameter size so that it produces the correctly sized figure.
   Here are four sample outputs of the program, with diamonds of size 1, 2, 4, and 7 respectively.
   Sample outputs:
   Size 1: Size 2: Size 4: Size 7:
   +--+
   |<>|
   +--+
   +----+
   | /\ |
   |<-->|
   | \/ |
   +----+
   +--------+
   | /\ |
   | /--\ |
   | /====\ |
   |<------>|
   | \====/ |
   | \--/ |
   | \/ |
   +--------+
   +--------------+
   | /\ |
   | /--\ |
   | /====\ |
   | /------\ |
   | /========\ |
   | /----------\ |
   |<============>|
   | \----------/ |
   | \========/ |
   | \------/ |
   | \====/ |
   | \--/ |
   | \/ |
   +--------------+
   Besides the top and bottom of the picture frame, each line of the diagram consists of the
   following:
4. The left side of the picture frame, followed by
5. Some number of spaces (including zero spaces on the line in the center), followed by
6. A forward slash ‘/’ if on the top half of the diamond or a back slash ‘\’ if on the bottom
   half of the diamond, or a left angle bracket ‘<’ if at the center of the diamond, followed
   by
7. Some number of hyphens ‘-’ or equal signs ‘=’ depending upon whether it was an even
   or odd line, followed by
8. A back slash ‘\’ if on the top half of the diamond or a forward slash ‘/’ if on the bottom
   half of the diamond, or a right angle bracket ‘>’ if at the center of the diamond, followed
   by
9. Some number of spaces, followed by
10. The right side of the picture frame.
    Each and every line of the diagram should end with a newline character. Be sure not to have any
    blank spaces before or after each line of the diagram. Be sure not to have any extra blank lines
    before or after the diagram.
    On any given execution, your program will produce just one version of the figure. However, you
    should refer to the variable size throughout your code, so that when a user enters a different
    value, your program would produce a figure of a different size. Your program should scale
    correctly for any size value of 1 or greater (regardless of the fact that the app only allows you
    to choose sizes 1 thru 8).
    Another significant component of this assignment is the task of recognizing or identifying
    sections of code that are identical (or redundant) in different parts of your program, and
    eliminating that redundancy by defining a method that contains that code and then calling the
    method from the appropriate points.
    Use of for-loops: This program is intended to test your knowledge of for-loops and conditionals.
    Some code will need to test whether you are printing an even numbered line or an odd numbered
    line. You can use the modulo division operator ‘%’ and test the remainder after division by two.
    For full credit, you should also create helper methods that can handle common or redundant tasks
    for you.
    Source code aesthetics (commenting, indentation, spacing, identifier names): You are required to
    properly indent your code and will lose points if you make significant indentation mistakes. No
    line of your code should be over 100 characters long (even better is limiting lines to 80
    characters). You should use a consistent programming style. This should include the following.
    • Create helper method as needed
    • Meaningful variable & method names
    • Consistent indenting
    • Use of "white-space" and blank lines to make the code more readable
    • Use of comments to explain pieces of tricky code

## Submission:


    See the assignment page in Coursera for instructions on using gradle to create the necessary zip
    file and submit it for evaluation by the auto-grader.

## Peer Assessment:
    You will be asked to evaluate three other student's projects as well as do a self-assessment of
    your own project.
